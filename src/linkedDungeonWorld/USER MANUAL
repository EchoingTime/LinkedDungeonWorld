USER MANUAL for linkedDungeonWorld created by Dante Anzalone

1) When running the Play class in the linkedDungeonWorld package, you will be asked to type in your name via scanner.

2) Select a class: You are given three pre-made classes, and the fourth one is a secret, which can be accessed if
you type "fighter" instead of "Fighter." The Over Lord seeks your death and this is one way to achieve that! Be
careful. The basic classes are the following: Fighter, Knight, or Ranger.

3) Directly after entering your desired class, you must choose 7 options: Display hero statistics as "4", 
view all the rooms remaining as "5", go through the left door "0", go through the right door "1", inspect the
left door "8", inspect the right door "9", or exit the game altogether "10". 

4) Enjoy! You will have to rely on the game's RNG to make it as far as you can before dying. Sometimes, if you
have bad luck, the devil, which is the boss, may sneak into one of the normal rooms! Use the shop to increase your
health and attack, be careful to input exactly what you see, else the shop Troll will become furious and penalize 
you. The program was supposed to be a doubly circular linked list, however, it seems like a mutated single linked
list! The goal is to stay alive as long as you possibly can and increase the amount of doors you have entered. The
last door, the light, generates a whole new dungeon, while the steel door is just the boss. May be in your best
interest to skip the boss if you are going for a high score, but as mentioned, he might sneak out!
